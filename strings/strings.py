# string is a sequence of characters
# anything inside quotes is considered a string in Python
# single and double quotes can be used
name = "ada lovelace"
print(name.title()) 
# .title() dot tells python to make the title() method act on the variable name
# The title() method returns a string where the first character in every word is upper case. Like a header, or a title. 
# If the word contains a number or a symbol, the first letter after that will be converted to upper case.
# Ada Lovelace

print(name.upper()) # ADA LOVELACE
print(name.lower()) # ada lovelace
